        <p class="text">
        Hi, my name is Zhiqi but you can call me Jackie. I am a computer science student at the University of Toronto and currently pursuing a degree in software engineering.
        Currently, I am interested in learning more about full-stack development and big data as paths to the future and development projects.
         My strongest skills and experiences are within object-oriented languages (like over 3 years of experiences in java) but I have also finished projects for HTML and CSS like this website as well as backend languages like PHP and SQL in UTSC Daily Planner.
        </p>
        <p class="text"> Being a problem solver is within my nature, whether that is designing a robot for a competition, build and design woodworking projects or solving a coding problem I love a good challenge.
          I love to learn and grow my skills further by challenging problems head-on. I hope that with my past experiences and skills that I can bring to the table that I will bring value to your development team.
          </p>
